<p style="color: aliceblue;">The HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language <br>
    for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It defines the meaning and structure<br>
     of web content. It is often assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)<br>
      and scripting languages such as JavaScript.<br>


    Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage <br>
    and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure<br>
     of a web page semantically and originally included cues for its appearance.<br>
    
    HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs,<br>
     images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the <br>
     rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured documents by denoting <br>
     structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes, <br>
     and other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. <br>
     Tags are directly introduce content into the page. Other tags surround and <br>
     provide information about document text and may include sub-element tags. <br>
     Browsers do not display the HTML tags but use them to interpret the content of the page.<br>
    
    HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language such as JavaScript, <br>
    which affects the behavior and content of web pages. The inclusion of CSS defines<br>
     the look and layout of content. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), former maintainer<br>
      of the HTML and current maintainer of the CSS standards, has encouraged the use of<br>
       CSS over explicit presentational HTML since 1997.[2] A form of HTML, known as HTML5<br>
