    <h3>FLOWERS</h3>
    <p>The rose is a type of <i>flowering shrub</i>. Its name comes from the Latin word Rosa.
        There are over three hundred species and tens of thousands of cultivars. The flowers of the rose grow in many different colors, from the well-known red rose or yellow rose and sometimes white or purple rose.
        Rose thorns are actually <b>prickles</b> – outgrowths of the epidermis
        Roses belong to the family of plants called Rosaceae. All roses were originally wild: they grew in North America, Europe, northwest Africa and many parts of Asia and Oceania. There are over 100 different species of roses. The wild rose species can be grown in gardens, but most garden roses are cultivars, which have been selected by people.
        Over hundreds of years they have been specially bred to produce a wide variety of growing habits and a broad range of colours from dark red to white including as well yellow and a bluish/lilac colour. Many roses have a strong, pleasant scent.
        Most roses have spines (incorrectly called thorns) on their stems. This is a common defense system in plants.
        Rose bushes are able to live in a wide variety of conditions. The fruit of the rose is called a <mark>hip</mark>. Some roses have decorative hips.</p>

<h5>Roses in legend and in history</h5>
<p>Roses are widely used across the world as symbols of love, sympathy or sorrow. Rose is widely used as a girl's name.
The rose was sacred to Venus. Venus was the Roman goddess of love and beauty. It was also linked with <b>Cupid</b> (son of Venus). He was the Roman god of desire – in one myth, he dropped nectar and the nectar bubbled up from the ground as roses. The rose was also sacred to Bacchus. He was the Roman god of wine. Rich Romans would lie on couches with roses laid on them. They would wear roses tied onto string around their neck. Anything which was said "under the rose" was considered to be a secret. Cleopatra VII of Egypt was said to have had a floor of her palace covered in roses before her lover Mark Antony visited her.</p>
<br>
<h5>Garden roses</h5>
<p>There are thousands of rose cultivars that people grow in gardens and on farms. The names used to describe the different types often refer to one species that is the main ancestor of that group, for example, Gallica roses are mostly descended from Rosa gallica. Other groups have several different species among their ancestors. Hybrid Tea roses, Floribunda roses, and English roses are the most common in gardens today.</p>

<h5>Poem by Robert Burns, <cite>‘A Red, Red Rose’</cite></h5>
<pre>
    O my Luve’s like a red, red rose
    That’s newly sprung in June;
    O my Luve’s like the melodie
    That’s sweetly play’d in tune …</pre>
