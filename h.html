  <h3>Flowers</h3>
  <h1 style="font-size:60px;">Flowers</h1>
  <p>A flower, also known as a bloom or blossom, is the reproductive structure found in flowering plants 
    (plants of the division Angiospermae).<br> Flowers consist of a combination of vegetative organs – sepals that enclose 
    and protect the developing flower, petals that attract pollinators, and reproductive organs that
     produce gametophytes, which in flowering plants produce gametes.</p>
  <p>A rose is either a woody perennial flowering plant of the genus Rosa (/ˈroʊzə/),[1] in the family
     Rosaceae (/roʊˈzeɪsiːˌiː/),[1] or the flower it bears. 
     There are over three hundred species and tens of thousands of cultivars.[citation needed]
      They form a group of plants that can be erect shrubs, climbing, or trailing, with stems
       that are often armed with sharp prickles.[2] Their flowers vary in 
    size and shape and are usually large and showy, in colours ranging from white
     through yellows and reds. Most species are native to Asia, with smaller numbers 
     native to Europe, North America, and northwestern Africa.</p>
   <p>Species, cultivars and hybrids are all widely grown for their beauty and often are fragrant.

    Roses have acquired cultural significance in many societies. Rose plants range in size from compact, miniature roses, to climbers that can reach seven meters in height.
    <hr>
     Different species hybridize easily, and this has been used in the development of the wide range of garden roses.</p>
     <h3>Poem</h3>
     <pre>
        There will come soft rain and the smell of the ground,

        And swallows circling with their shimmering sound;

        And frogs in the pools singing at night,

        And wild plum trees in tremulous white;

        Robins will wear their feathery fire,

        Whistling their whims on a low fence-wire;</pre>
