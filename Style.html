    <p style="text-align: justify;">The rose is a type of flowering shrub. Its name comes from the Latin word Rosa.[1]
        There are over three hundred species and tens of thousands of cultivars. The flowers 
        of the rose grow in many different colors, from the well-known red rose or yellow rose 
        and sometimes white or purple rose.
        Rose thorns are actually prickles â€“ outgrowths of the epidermis
        Roses belong to the family of plants called Rosaceae. All roses were originally wild: they grew in
         North America, Europe, northwest Africa and many parts of Asia and Oceania. There are over 100 different
          species of roses. The wild rose species can be grown in gardens, but most garden roses are cultivars, which have been selected by people.[2]</p>
