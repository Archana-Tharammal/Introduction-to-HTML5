    <h2>Overflow: visible</h2>

<p>By default, the overflow is visible, meaning that it is not clipped and it renders outside the element's box:</p>

<div>In CSS, overflow occurs when an element's content does not fit entirely inside the element box. This can happen when an element has a specified height that's too small for the content it contains. You can use the CSS overflow property to control what happens to the overflow.You can use the overflow property when you want to have better control of the layout. The overflow property specifies what happens if content overflows an element's box.</div>
